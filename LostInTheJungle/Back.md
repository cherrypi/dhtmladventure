  You trudge back to the river and cast your line. You sit... And sit... And
  sit. All of the sudden you notice a small whirring noise thats been building
  up for a while. You sit up and peer down the river. A white dot is growing
  bigger and bigger until it's almost upon you. A beat up speedboat comes to a
  stop before you. Two familiar faces stare down at you. "Emily, Bret?!" you
  question. "Of course dummy!"Bret teases. "Cut him some slack!"Emily argues as
  a smile creeps across her face. They haul you up and and you trade stories.
