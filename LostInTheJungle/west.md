You trudge westward. You walk for ages. Your stomach groans and sweat trickles
down your brow. In the distance you see a tree with what looks like bright
yellow crescents hanging from it. You pick up your pace. You eventually see that
they are bananas. You pluck the bottom bunch. Do you [eat them here](./here.md)
or get a lot and bring them back?
