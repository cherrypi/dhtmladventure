You build a wooden mechanism that almost looks like a mouse trap but for fish.
You carefully place it in the water and put a dead fly in the back. You sit
there waiting, your hand holding the spear. A silver fish darts around for a
while staring at the bait suspiciously. Unexpectedly it lunges at the bait and
you're too slow and just scrape the fin as it dances away. You put more bait
down and wait for a little while more. This time a medium fish flashes quickly
around the trap eying the bait. It slowly creeps forward which gives you time to
lunge. You slowly remove it from the spear. Do you [eat it now](./eat1.md) or
[eat it later](./eat2.md)?
