You take out your climbing gear. You slowly lower yourself down the face of the
cliff. You get to about halfway down and take a break. You look around. All of a
sudden the ledge you are standing on gives way. You hang there, your heart
beating, you try reaching another ledge but your leg can't reach it. Sweat
trickles down your now shining forehead. Do you [jump](./jump.md) off or [hold
on](./hold.md)?
