  You take out your climbing gear. You slowly lower your self down the face of
  the cliff. You get to about half way down and take a break. You look around.
  All of the sudden the ledge you are standing on gives way. You hang there,
  your heart beating, you try reaching another ledge but your leg can't reach
  it. Sweat trickles down your now shining forehead. Do you [jump](./jump.md)
  off or [hold on](./hold.md)?
