You slowly raise yourself and grab a hand hold above you. You take a cautious step onto a small foothold. You then hoist yourself up and reach for the next one. As you reach your foot slips and you tumble down. You fall for about 10 yards before your clothes snag on a outcrop. You sweat, shiver, and tremble as rocks bounce down the cliff side. The your clothes slip a little bit. You then fall and crumple on the ground beneath you. Then everything goes black. You wake up and you are standing in a glade. You look around wondering if you hit your head to hard. You realize someone is standing next to you. A man in white stares at you. "I'm gandalf the white!" he says. You stare at the sky dizzy. You then wake up on the jungle floor and excruciating pain floods through you. This is reality you think. You must of passed out from the pain. You can't continue like this.
