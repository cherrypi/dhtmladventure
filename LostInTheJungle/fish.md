You walk for a while 'till you get to a glistening pond. You fashion a stick
into a crude spear with a stone. Ripples move through the water as you scan the
pond. A minuscule vivid orange fish darts around. You watch it for a while
before lunging with your spear. You miss and grumble as the fish swims away. You
this time see a purple, larger fish with yellow stripes, slowly ambling across
the shallows. You again miss, and cry in frustration as at it swims in circles
as if doing a victory dance. Another small fish paddles by. This time you don't
even aim. You just throw your stick and watch it sink into the wet dirt. You
sigh. You're not going to get far like this. Do you make a [trap](./trap.md) or
an [enclosure](./enclosure.md) to contain the fish?
