  You at first can't think of anything that needs to be done so you clean the
twigs up and brush the leaves away so a ember won't fall on them and create a
forest fire. You then amble over to your enclosure and spear one of the fish.
You carefully lower it on the metal grill above the camp stove. You then go and
tend to the fire.
  After a while you hear a loud whirring noise. You glance at
the sky and see a red helicopter heading your way. Apparently the smoke
attracted a fire fighting helicopter. It stops all of the sudden and you think
the pilot might have noticed you.
  It then creeps forward and descends toward the
ground when it's about 30 feet above you a ladder drops and a person climbs down
and helps you up. You then tell them your name and tell them all about what
happened. They then call your friends and you a are united once more.

##You Survived
Yayyyyyy!
