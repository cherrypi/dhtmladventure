You slowly squeeze the berry until a drop of juice falls onto your hand. You
slowly slurp the juice. You wait 10 minutes and then go back. You pick up your
berry and now take a small bite. You wait another 10 minutes. You then go back
and bite half of it off. 10 minutes later you come back and bite one of them.
Next time you grab and slowly munch those. Eventually you scoop three handfuls
and put them in a Ziplock bag. You walk down the path a little more until you
get to a rock. You stare up at the trees. Until you hear the familiar noise of
the hum of planes. You run onto the runway. Two people are boarding the
expedition plane. You rush forward. "Emily, Bret!" you cry! They turn.
"Robert!?" Emily yells surprised. They rush to you and you all board the plane.

#YAY
You did it!
