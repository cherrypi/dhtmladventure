You happily get up and look for some thing fun. You rummage through your bag and
find a bouncy ball which you assume was put in there by you're son who eagerly
wanted to help with packing. You silently thanked him. you bounce the ball and
chase it after throwing it. You take occasional breaks to tend to the fire and
clear the leaves and sticks away. A fire fighting helicopter notices the smoke
and comes to check it out. The pilot spots you and gets closer to the ground a
lowers a ladder. you come aboard and explain what happened. You're saved!


##Good job!
