You proceed to keep crawling. The day slowly dims into a pitch black night. You can't see a thing and your lost. You have no idea were your going until your hand connects with freezing water. You recoil slightly. You didn't hear the russhing water over all the the oise in the jungle. You think this maybe the stream the origanal path was following. You follow it for a while before it turns into a waterfall.
*"Uh Oh!"* You think. You were no where near a waterfall when you were on the trail. Your eyes widen in fear you are now completley lost and there is no where to go.
