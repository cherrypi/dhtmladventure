You proceed to keep crawling. The day slowly dims into a pitch black night. You
can't see a thing and your lost. You have no idea were your going until your
hand connects with freezing water. You recoil slightly. You didn't hear the
rushing water over all the the noise in the jungle. You think this maybe the
stream the original path was following. You follow it for a while before it
turns into a waterfall. *"Uh Oh!"* You think. You were no where near a waterfall
when you were on the trail. Your eyes widen in fear you are now completely lost
and there is no where to go.
