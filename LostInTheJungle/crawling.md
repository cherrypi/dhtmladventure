You proceed to crawl. The day slowly dims into a pitch black night. You can't
see a thing and you're lost. You have no idea were you're going until your hand
connects with freezing water. You recoil slightly. You didn't hear the rushing
water over all the the noise in the jungle. You think this is maybe the stream
the original path was following. You follow it for a while before it turns into
a waterfall. *"Uh Oh!"* You think. You were no where near a waterfall when you
were on the trail. Your eyes widen in fear you are now completely lost and there
is nowhere to go.
