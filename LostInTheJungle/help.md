You keep get up and take a step. Pain flashes through your foot. Your not going
to get far walking you realize. You start to crawl against the jungle floor.
Your foot doesn't throb as much but it still slows you down. You crawl like this
for a mile before stopping for a break. You realize that the sun is hanging low
in the sky. Do you [stop and set up camp for the night](./campnight.md) or do
you [continue crawling](./crawling.md) through the night?
