# Lost in The Jungle

![Rain forest from wikimedia][MainImage]

"*What the?*" You think. You look around. You had just bent down to get a bottle
water out of your backpack, and BAM! They've disipeared. Maybe they just
continued down the trail without you. You keep trekking through the jungle
undergrowth. All of the sudden your foot snags on a root, and you tumble on to
the dirt. You inhale sharply as pain sears from your foot. You hold back tears.
You try standing up but in response the pain becomes even more sharp. You sit
back down again.

"*Not a good sign.*" You think. You might be able to [try to find some
help](./help.md) nearby but risk putting more pressure on your foot or do you
[camp out](./camp.md) and wait for it to heal.
