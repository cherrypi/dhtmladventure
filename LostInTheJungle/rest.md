You take a rest and recover. You lie down and nod off. You wake up and shiver.
You reach for your pack and feel air. You spin wildly around. All your stuff has
been stolen! You can't survive with out it!You watch the trees waver around. You
think to yourself "Why is it always the ankle?". You turn around and sigh. You
walk and circles but can't think of what to do. A bird flutters overhead. You
sob in frustration. You sit and stare at the ground.

#You Snooze You Lose. Better luck next time.
