You walk out side and find a long stick. You then take out a pocket knife and
cut holes in it. You then go back to your backpack and pull out some string. You
push the string through the holes. You pick one of the spikes out of your bag
and tie the string to it. *"Now for some bait."* You think. You pull out your
spade. You dig up some dirt and a worm crawls out. You snatch it and stick it on
the spike. You limp over to the river and throw your line in. A little tug
alerts you, you reel in a medium sized fish. You then limp back to camp and put
it on top of the camp stove you watch it sizzle and fizz. It might support you
for 2 or 3 days. Do you [go back](./Back.md) and get more or spend time and find
a [new food source](./newsource.md)?
