You walk out side and find a long stick. You then take out a pocket knife and
cut loops in it. You then go back to your backpack and pull out some string. You
push the string through the loops. You pick one of the spokes out of your bag
and tie the string to it. *"Now for some bait."* You think. A mosquito lands on
you. You smack it and attach it to the spoke. You limp over to the river and
throw your line in. A little tug alerts you, you reel in a medium sized fish.
You then limp back to camp and put it on top of the camp stove you watch it
sizzle and fizz. It might support you for 2 or 3 days. Do you go back and get
more or spend time and find a new food source?
