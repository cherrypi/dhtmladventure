You march down and take out a frying pan. "I'll hit you if you don't give me
fish!" You shout. They stare at you. "I don't know what your thinking going
around shouting, so go away and leave us in peace." one says. You sigh and walk
away. They'll never give you the fish now. Do you go back or venture over the
canyon?
