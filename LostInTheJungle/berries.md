You rummage through the bushes, hurriedly looking for anything that looked like
a berry. You bump into a bush at the edge of the cliff that has a magenta
colored berry hanging from most of its many leaves. You pick one off and look at
it. You don't know if it is poisonous. You burrow in your bag till you find a
handbook about camping in the wilderness. Your friends and you all bought one
before going on the adventure. As you are flipping through the pages a bird
calls loudly above you. You jump surprised and drop the book. It bounces slowly
and surely down the cliff and you sink to the ground. Do you taste the berry or
leave it alone?
