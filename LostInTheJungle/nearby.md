You start scavenging around the area. You look for any more holes but don't seem
to find one. You go back for a drink of water. All of the sudden something pokes
you on the back. You turn around to see your colleagues. "Emily, Bret!" You cry.
They haul you up and take you to the airport. You tell them what happened and
you smile as they laugh and gasp at your story.  

# Yay!
You won!
