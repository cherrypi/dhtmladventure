You decide to set up camp for the night. You put up your tent and nod off... You
wake up, after stretching you feel refreshed! Your foot gives violent flashes of
pain but it's not as bad as yesterday. You think you might have twisted it
really bad. You keep on walking until You come to a fork in the road. You can't
remember which way you went. [left](./left.md) or [right](./right.md)?
