You decide to set up camp for the night. You put up your tent and nod off... You
wake up in the morning stretching, you feel refreshed! Your foot gives violent
flashes of pain but it's not as bad as yesterday. You think you might have
twisted it really bad. You keep on walking until you come to a fork in the road.
You can't remember wich way you went. [left](./left.md) or [right](./right.md)?
