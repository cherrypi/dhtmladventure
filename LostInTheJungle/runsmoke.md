You run away. You're so tired and focused on running that you bump into someone.
You look up and see two familiar faces. "Hi" you mumble. "HI IS ALL YOU SAY?!
YOU SCARED US TO DEATH!" familiar face one shouts. "Calm down Emily! He went
through a lot to" the other says. Emily and Bret haul you up and escort you
home.
