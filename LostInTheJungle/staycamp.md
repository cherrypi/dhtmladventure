You stay at camp and rest through the night. A bird chirps over head. You look
down at your foot which is almost healed except for some soreness every time you
walk. The tropical trees fill your eyes with vibrant colors. Well stretching you
decide that you should start moving. A little frog hops down the path well you
pack the tent.

You pick up your pack and slowly shuffle down the path. All of the sudden a
voice cries out "Robert?" You look around surprised. A pair of familiar faces
are staring at you from 20 or so yards down the path. You blink, your eyes are
not deceiving you. "Emily, Bret!" you cry. You huddle together and they take you
to the boat. You tell them about all the adventures you had and they laugh. You
feel happy once more.

# You Have Survived The Jungle.
Congratulations
