# Camp

You get out your bright yellow tent and hammer in the spokes. It was originally
designed to hold 3 people so you'll have a lot room tonight. You get out the
small camp stove and set it up. You look around and realize Bert was carrying
the food but he's far ahead at the airport waiting anxiously in the expedition
plane for you, so you'll have to find your own food. You know theirs a river a
few yards down the trail so you could go fishing but you'd need to make a
fishing rod or you could try to find fruit in the jungle. Do you look for
[fruit](./fruit.md) or go [fishing](./fishing.md)?
