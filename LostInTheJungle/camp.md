 # Camp

You get out your bright yellow tent and hammer in the hooks. It was originally
designed to hold 3 people so you'll have a lot room tonight. You get out the
small camp stove and set it  up. You realize Bert was carrying the food. But
he's at the airport. You'll need to find your on food. You know theirs a river a
few yards down the trail so you could go fishing. But you'd need to make a
fishing rod, or you could try to find fruit in the jungle. Do you look for
[fruit](./fruit.md) or go [fishing](./fishing.md)?
