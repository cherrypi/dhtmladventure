You hike for a long time. Your clothes feel like they were dumped in a puddle.
As you walk your backpack seems to grow until you can't go any farther. You
stumble on to a rock and drink your whole water bottle. You sit there for a
while. In the corner of your eye you see a white flash. You look up and see a
airplane flying overhead. All of a sudden you feel like you could jump off a
cliff. You race down the path for what seems like seconds until coming to a
gate. Behind it you see a small airport. On the runway the expedition plane sits
at the ready! You race to it and climb inside! According to the pilot your
friends had gone looking for you. You radio them and 3 hours later you're
lifting off!

GOOD JOB!
