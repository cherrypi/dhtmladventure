You go into the bushes looking for a sign of fruit. You eventually stumble upon
what looks like a banana tree. You squint up at the sun through the leaves. If
your ever going to get up there your going to need to climb which will be a
hassle with your fractured foot. You look around to see if there is any thing
that might help you. You notice some vines which you could use to make a rope
ladder. You go back to camp and get out your survival book which you brought
along with you. You go back to the tree and follow the instructions to make a
rope. You eventually twist tie and knot the vine into what looks like a rope
ladder. You Try throwing the what you'll call a vine ladder on to the lowest
hanging branch. It takes you 17 times to finally get it to hook on. You climb up
the ladder. You slowly pluck 3 bananas of the tree and climb down. You walk to
camp triumphant. You wake up the next morning fed and rested. Your foot has only
improved a little bit. [Do you stay a camp](./staycamp.md) or do you continue
