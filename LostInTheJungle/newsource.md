You rush out in to the woods looking excitingly for a new food source. You all
of the sudden realize that you have no idea where you are. You pat yourself down
and realize you didn't bring your map. You try going back to where you came from
but you end up going in circles. You hunker down. You don't remember passing by
any of this. You are completely lost!

#OH NO!!!!!!
