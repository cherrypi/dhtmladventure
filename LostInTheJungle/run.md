You take off at a fast pace. The snake watches you and hisses. You leap over a
root an crouch behind it. A caterpillar inches across the ground. You watch the
snake look around confused and then slither away. You let out a breath you
didn't know you were holding. The little caterpillar stares at you. You slowly
get up. You brush the dirt off your knees. You then continue up the trail. You
keep walking on for a while before stopping. You look up at the trees. You will
need to find food to continue any farther. Do you [find some
berries](./berries.md) or [look for a source of fish](./fish.md).
