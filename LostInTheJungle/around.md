Slowly creeping along the edge of the cliff, You find a little slope you can
walk up. You walk along your little pathway and look at the shrubbery. A bright blue butterfly prances in the air. You chase it, laughing for the first
time on your mini adventure. Having so much fun you almost run into a snake.
Its head curves to peer at you. You're not sure if it's poisonous but you don't
want to find out. Do you [run](./run.md) or [stand still](./still.md)?
