You grip the edge as rocks tumble down the cliff side. A quarter of your ledge
crumbles and your heart beats so fast you think it might pop out. A ant crawls
across and you feel a sudden urge of hate towards it carelessly walking around
while you hang here. You can't hold on much longer. You think you maybe able to
sacrifice your grip to [grab the climbing gear](./climbgear.md) or you could
[find a more sturdy ledge to grab onto](./grab.md)?
