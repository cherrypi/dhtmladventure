# Lemonade Stand

You decied that it is time to get some **money**. You go for the classic 
lemonade stand. You get some pine wood planks, some nails, and a yellow banner.
You then proceed to create your stand, with help from your father you nail together the boards
, and write *"lemonade 5 cents"* on the sign. You and your father stand back
and admire your craft. Now all that is left is making the lemonade. You go to
the store and get 10 lemons, some sugar, and some bottled water. Your mom helps you make lemonade at home.
You fill a jug up with lemonade and stick it in a cooler, you grab some cups well your there. You
then wait for a hot summer day when your sure to get customers. Finally the perfect day comes at a sweltering **91 degrees**
in the middle of the day! You set up your stand a little ways down the sidewalk.
You stand out their for ten minutes watching a butterfly flutter up and down your lawn
before getting your first customer. She was a girl around 12 who was skipping around the block.
She looked like a likely customer so you poured a cup of lemonade.
Just as you predicted she came prancing over handed you 5 cents and asked for a cup. You happily
handed your first customer a glass of lemonade.
