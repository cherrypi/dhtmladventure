# Knowledge

You pursue the path of knowledge, though you don't know who will teach you you
thought maybe could go to the [old scholar](./scholar.md) who works at the
school, the [middle aged scientist](./sientest.md) who lives in the small house
in the forest, or the [young tutor](./tutor.md) that teaches anybody who is
interested. It's hard choice but eventually your going to have to pick one of
them.
