# Direction

You think direction will be helpful. You go to the old miner who has a very
good sense of direction he says that you need a compass to help you even if you
have a good sense of direction. You know of only two people who make compasses.
one makes [poor quality but cheap compasses](./cheap compass.md), and the other
makes [expensive but high quality compasses](./expensive compass.md). You only
have 10 gold 15 silver and 5 copper, which shall it be.
