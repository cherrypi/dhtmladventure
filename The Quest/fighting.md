# Fighting

You think fighting will be the most useful. You go to the middle aged
swordsman that lives by the town gates. He says he will teach you as long as you
give him something in return. He doesn't say what he wants so you are left 
clueless, though you do have a few ideas. You think maybe he might want 
[money](./money.md), a [friend](./freind.md) because he's lonely by himself, or a new 
[sword](./sword.md) because his old one is rusty. Any one might convince him but your
not sure which.
