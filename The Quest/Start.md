# The Begging of The Quest

You live in a small town with the rest of your family. You and your family have
become increasingly poor over the months. You decide the best way to get more
money fast is to get to the treasure room in the ruins. The old man that works
at the cooper has talked many times about it. He has talked about the countless
riddles, monsters, obstacles, and mazes leading up to it but in the end you
think it will be worth it. You imagine the fame and fortune that will come if
you complete this task. Millions of other people have failed but you fell lucky,
but before you do this you must have something to help you along the way. For
the riddles you will need knowledge, for the monsters you will need to be
skilled at fighting, for the mazes you must have a sense of direction, and for
the obstacles you will need to be very fit. But you are none. You will need to
train to become skilled in these tasks, but you only have time to become skilled
in one. Do you train in [knowledge](./knowledge.md), [fighting](./fighting.md),
[direction](./direction.md), or [fitness](./fitness.md).
