You offer the swordsman to be his friend if you train him. He stares at you happily. "Really?" he says. "Positive."you say.
He huddles you inside. His house is small with a wood stove, two mahgony chairs, a fireplace, 
and a medium bed with silk coverings. He starts training you. 
It goes on for a month before he thinks your are skilled enough. He asks what weapon 
would you like before you go into the dungeon. 
You say that your not a violent guy so is their anything non violent. 
He points to a shelf that has a blowgun with sleeping darts . 
You pick it and tell the swordsman that when you come back they will be the best of friends.
